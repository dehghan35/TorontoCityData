To install the dependencies, do the following:
- On Mac/Linux: sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
- Windows: Open terminal in admin mode and then type: pip install -r requirements.txt
Packages such as:
- numpy
- sqlite3
should already come with your Python install, if not install them manually using pip.
